<h2 id="first-post" class="heading">Why I started programming</h2>
<h6 class="date">Mon 5:45p PM 1/21/23</h6>

<p>The main reason I started to learn how to program is that I enjoyed the challenge of learning how to solve a problem. Although learning to program involves learning the syntax of a language and the various ways of how to make it work, the most exciting part of programming is learning how to solve a problem. I'm really looking forward to pushing forward and learning some new things</p>

<h2 id="second-post" class="heading">What have I been studying?</h2>
<h6 class="date">Mon 12:07p PM 1/22/23</h6>

<p>I started out some time ago by studying a course called <em>Program Principles I/II</em> that went through the process of solving problems using C++. <br>
After that, I started working on a variety of different problems using <em>Informatics</em>. While this was interesting, I missed out on the structure of a course. <br>
Now, I'm working on a series of courses that is listed in the Khan Academy. This selection of courses is intended to get me to the point that I can start applying for programming jobs.</p>
<p id="future-plans">I intend to work on these courses independently while also working on projects that help me practice and develop my programming skills.</p>
